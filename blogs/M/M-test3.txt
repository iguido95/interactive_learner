As strangely beautiful the storm is ... it has it's way of affecting moods negatively. It's been raining non-stop for four days now. It seems that I haven't slept in as long.   I plan all day ... creating to do lists and checking over them to make sure i've missed nothing. Though when i'm home at last my mind begins to wander and I make up new projects as I go ... after cleaning the damn house of course. I did finally dig into a project for a friends Web Developing business. I'm mixing the music and sound effects for his clients page.   Just because i'm such a nice guy, I let the cats in out of the rain. In thanks they procees to take over the house ... two on the couch and one who loves my computer chair. Everywhere I go I have to shoe cats away. Good thing I like them. ;)  A friend gave me an article a few weeks ago. It talks about how writers are the worlds best procrastinators ... finding any excuse not to write. Nah ... not me! I love to write. hummm ... I successfully put off writing anything today and I actually had this full day off. Where is that article on writer's block? I'm going to need that.
